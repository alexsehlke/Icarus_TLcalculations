# Thermoluminescence Calculations

We provide tools to conveniently calculate the thermoluminescence (TL) peak and the timescale needed for a given TL peak to reach equilibrium. Our repository includes two main scripts and a Jupyter Notebook for these purposes.

## Scripts

### 1. TL_2ndOrderKineticsPeak.py

This script calculates the TL intensity as a function of the glow curve temperature using second-order kinetics.

**Usage:**
```bash
python TL_2ndOrderKineticsPeak.py
'''bash
2. TL_EquilibrationTime.py
This script calculates the build-up of TL over time based on selected kinetic parameters.

Usage:

python TL_EquilibrationTime.py

Jupyter Notebook
We also provide a Jupyter Notebook, Thermoluminescence_Calculations.ipynb, which includes additional documentation and interactive features for using the scripts. This notebook serves as an excellent tool for exploring the calculations in more detail.

Output
All scripts output:

An image file representing the calculated TL data.
A CSV file containing the accompanying data, stored in the calculations subfolder.
Installation and Dependencies
To run these scripts, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the necessary packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Example Outputs
Examples of the outputs from the scripts, including images and CSV files, can be found in the examples subfolder.
