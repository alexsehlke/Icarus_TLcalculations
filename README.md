The two oython scripts provides a quick and convenient way to calculate the TL peak and equilibration timescales.

Script 'TL_2ndOrderKineticsPeak.py' gives the user the opportunity to calculate the TL intensity as a function of glow curve temperature.
Script 'TL_EquilibrationTime.py/ gives the user the opportunity to calculate the build-up of TL over time based on selected kinetics parameters.
