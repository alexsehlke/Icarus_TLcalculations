We wish to provide means to cnveniently calculate the TL peak and timescale needed for a given TL peak to reach equilibrium.
We make two scripts available:

Script 1: 'TL_2ndOrderKineticsPeak.py' gives the user the opportunity to calculate the TL intensity as a function of glow curve temperature.
Script 2: 'TL_EquilibrationTime.py/ gives the user the opportunity to calculate the build-up of TL over time based on selected kinetics parameters.

We also provide the calculations implemennted into a Jupyter Notebook, with additional documentatuion for the use of the scripts.
